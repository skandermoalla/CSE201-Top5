## How to play the game

The user is assigned a team of 12 players in a championship. Each player has specific attributes: age, height, weight, motivation, energy, etc. and specific skills: offensive, defensive, etc. All of these attributes determine the overall value of each player. The mananger is also assigned a budget.

Each season week, the user performs one basketball game. From the main window, he can have access to the calendar of all his team's matches of the season. Thus, the manager can prepare his team differently, depending on which team he is going to face.

The manager can also train his players in order to improve their skills in exchange for money and energy. 
The user also has the option to buy or sell players on the market. 

On the main window, the user can have access to information about the League he is evolving in, including the season ranking. The season ranking is updated after every match. 

Before playing a match, the manager can choose the players he wishes to start with. 

During a match, the user has the chance to interact with the game by choosing the tactics. He can also substitute players during a game. The game is broken down into subgames, each one corresponding to an attack or a defence. The outcome of a subgame is determined probabilistically, depending on the performance indices of the players of each team, and the tactic chosen. The user is kept informed of the game's progress through dynamic commentaries.  

The goal of the user, as a manager, is to make his team progress from league to league, each season, by the performances of his team (wins and losses). 

Finally, before exiting the game, the user can save his progression.
